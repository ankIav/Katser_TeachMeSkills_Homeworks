# inputting v0.0.1

A simple way to input _int_ and _float_ values without any errors.

## Why do you need this library?

Modules are more extensible than the existing blueprints, and allow
modules to be hot-loaded, load from a configuration file and for code to be
executed on load, for instance, to initialize another extension

## Getting Started

It's as simple as:

```python
from inputting import inting
from inputting import floating
```
